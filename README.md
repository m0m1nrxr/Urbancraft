## Inspiration
We love Minecraft ❤️and we love our city Peshawar. We want Peshawar to have places like Shalman Park to have more facilities for Kids and Families.

## What it does
Our project is a digital representation of our vision for Parks like Shalman Park and others to have state-of-the-art facilities and Fun activities for our community which includes people of all ages.

## How we built it
We designed the whole park in Minecraft because we love Minecraft. Since we are kids and don't know any other tools in depth Minecraft was the only tool we could use to express our vision.

## Challenges we ran into
Since this is our first project and our first Hackathon our biggest challenge was how we could build the whole Park. We also face some design issues while designing the individual details 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we have done with our idea since we have learned a lot from it.

## What we learned
We have learned how to express ourselves creatively, We have learned how to critically think about a solution for our problem.

## What's next for Urbancraft
We have our own server setup with this small solution but we want to grow this to design for the whole City. Our Map is also going to be open to other contributors so they can help us build our vision for Peshawar.

## How can this be connected to GovTech
We will also provide the Map as an API from Minecraft API so that we can build a dashboard for this Map.
